# Hotel Booking Prediction System

## Overview
The **Hotel Booking Prediction System** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict whether a customer will complete a hotel booking. This system helps hotel businesses optimize occupancy rates and improve customer service by analyzing key factors that influence booking decisions.

## Features
- **Predictive Modeling**: Uses machine learning techniques to forecast whether a booking will be confirmed or canceled.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into customer booking behaviors.
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess model performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides easy-to-read predictions and visualizations.

## Technologies Used
### Software
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning model development.
  - `XGBoost`: For advanced gradient boosting.

### Hardware
- Standard computer with Python environment.

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
   - Loads historical hotel booking data.
   - Cleans and preprocesses data for model training.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Identifies trends and patterns in booking behaviors.
   - Visualizes important features affecting booking outcomes.

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Trains various machine learning models.
   - Evaluates model performance using classification metrics.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Uses the best-performing model to predict booking confirmations.
